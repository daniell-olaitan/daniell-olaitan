# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Olaitan

🚀 I'm a **Software Developer** with a strong focus on building **scalable** and **maintainable** systems. I have a strong foundation in **Python** and **JavaScript/TypeScript**. I develop backend services using frameworks like **Flask**, **FastAPI**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**, and I also write automation scripts, SDKs, and tools that support development workflows.

🤖 I'm currently exploring the exciting fields of **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**, combining software engineering principles with intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.
